### Hi 👋

I’m a senior software engineer with a focus on backend systems, developer tooling,
and automation that removes operational friction.

- Python / Django, distributed systems, containers
- Product-oriented engineering, not framework chasing
- Strong interest in performance, reliability, and system behavior under load

#### Selected projects
- **ER_Tool** – A practical ER diagram and schema exploration tool for relational databases
- **goto** – A small productivity tool for fast shell navigation

Most of my professional work lives in private repositories.
